# Key Capturer

A website that listens for the keys you pressed and displays their keycode automatically

## Motivation

I tend to not have a good memory, especially with numbers, and I noticed that I often Google for the keycodes for keys like ENTER or the letter 'a'. Even though opening a new tab and searching it on Google doesn't take too much time, I wanted a way to quickly view the keycode for a particular key by just hitting it on my keyboard. Hence, the reason why I developed this small utility website.

You might argue that in order to make use of this utility, one would have to open a new tab and navigate to this site which would probably take them about the same time as searching it on Google. I don't disagree and I think you have a point, however, I think this way of looking up keycodes is way cooler! :D
