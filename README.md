# Key Capturer

A program that will listen to the keys you pressed and display the key and its keycode on screen.

# Motivation

I tend to not have a good memory, especially with numbers, and I noticed that I always Google for the keycode for keys like ENTER or the letter 'a'. Even though opening up a new tab and searching it up on Google doesn't take too much time, I wanted a way to quickly view the keycode for a particular key by just hitting it on keyboard. Hence, this is the reason why I developed this small utility website. You might argue that in order to make use of this utility, one would have to open a new tab and navigate to this site which would probably take you about the same time as searching it up on Google. I don't disagree and I think you have a point, however, I think there is a certain amount of coolness to be able to automate some boring task! :D
